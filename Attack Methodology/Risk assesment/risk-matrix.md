**Risk Assessment Matrix** tailored to our **web application threat model** based on the three attack scenarios (AI-Generated Phishing Email, SQL Injection, and XSS with Session Hijacking) while incorporating the **STRIDE**, **MITRE ATT&CK**, and **Kill Chain** methodologies.

| **Risk ID** | **Description**                                             | **Threat Model (STRIDE)**          | **MITRE ATT&CK**                        | **Kill Chain**                              | **Severity** | **Likelihood** | **Impact** | **Mitigation Plan**                                                   |
