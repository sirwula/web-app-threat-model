A high-level diagram for our web application.

1.User Interaction: This includes both the Web Browser User (the typical user accessing the application through their browser) and Administrator (with elevated privileges).
2.Frontend: The Web Application Interface is what the user sees and interacts with, whether they are an admin or a regular user.
3.Backend: The Application Server handles logic, processes requests, and communicates with both the database and external services.
4.Database: The Database Server securely stores user data, transaction records, session information, and other sensitive data.
5.External Services:
Authentication Service: Ensures proper user authentication, possibly with MFA.
Payment Gateway: Manages online financial transactions securely.
