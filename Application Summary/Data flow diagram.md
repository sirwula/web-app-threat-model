The system under analysis is a web-based application that provides users with access to a secure platform for managing sensitive information, such as user profiles, transactions, and administrative functions. The application includes a login system, a database for storing user information, and various forms for data input and interactions with backend services.

Key Components:
Frontend (User Interface):

The web application is built with modern web technologies (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to provide an intuitive user interface for account creation, login, and interaction with system functionalities.
Input fields on various forms allow users to submit data that is processed by the backend.
Backend (Server-Side Logic):

The backend system processes user inputs, performs authentication, and interacts with the database.
It is responsible for validating and sanitizing user inputs to prevent attacks like SQL injection and XSS.
Database:

The application uses a relational database to store user information, credentials, and transaction logs.
Sensitive information, such as passwords, is stored securely using hashing mechanisms.
Authentication & Authorization:

The system uses a role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism to differentiate between normal users and administrative users.
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is optionally available for users to enhance security.
Third-Party Integrations:

The application utilizes various third-party libraries and services for functionalities such as user authentication, data analytics, and payment gateways.
Security Considerations:
User Authentication: Standard username and password combinations with support for MFA.
Sensitive Data Protection: Encryption protocols (such as TLS/SSL) are employed to protect data in transit, while sensitive data at rest is hashed or encrypted.
Input Validation: The system implements basic input validation for user inputs to reduce the risk of attacks such as SQL injection and XSS.

## Key Components:

USER: Represents both regular users and administrative users interacting with the application.

LOGIN: Entry point for user authentication.

SESSION: Established upon successful login, storing session data in the database.

INPUT-FORM: Represents user inputs, which are processed by the backend.

BACKEND: The server-side component responsible for processing input, authenticating users, and interacting with the database and third-party services.

DATABASE: Stores sensitive data such as user information, credentials, and session details.

ADMIN: Represents the administrative user with elevated privileges.

THIRD-PARTY-SERVICE: External services integrated into the application (e.g., payment gateways, analytics).

Attack Entry Points:

Phishing: Attackers may attempt to compromise admin credentials through phishing emails, which target the LOGIN process.
SQL Injection: Malicious inputs can be submitted via the INPUT-FORM, targeting the backend's interaction with the database.
XSS Attack: Malicious scripts are injected into the input form, targeting users by manipulating client-side interactions.

A diagram is shared with the engineering team for validation and to highlight critical areas for security focus.

Hereâ€™s a Data Flow Diagram (DFD)  for the web application threat model we are working on, showing key critical areas of the system that could be targeted by attackers:
