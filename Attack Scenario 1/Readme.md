# Attack 1 Summary: AI Generated External phishing email utilising admin credentials

# Stages of the Attack
## Origins
The attack is initiated by a malicious actor leveraging well-established cyber attack techniques. The attacker identifies the web application as a target due to its exposure to sensitive user data and its public-facing nature, making it an attractive opportunity for data theft and exploitation.

## Reconnaissance
The attacker conducts research to gather information about the application's architecture, technologies, and potential security vulnerabilities. They analyze entry points like user authentication, input fields, and integration with third-party services, looking for weaknesses in security measures.

## Weaponization
After identifying vulnerabilities, such as the potential for SQL injection and XSS (cross-site scripting), the attacker crafts exploit payloads specifically targeting these issues. Additionally, they design AI-generated phishing emails aimed at administrators to steal login credentials and gain elevated access.

## Delivery
Phishing emails containing malicious links or attachments are sent to both administrators and users of the web application. These emails are carefully tailored to mimic official communication from the application, increasing the chances of users interacting with the malicious content.

## Exploitation
The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the web application, such as SQL injection to manipulate database queries or XSS to inject malicious scripts into the applicationâ€™s frontend. Through these exploits, the attacker can execute unauthorized code, steal session tokens, or extract sensitive user data.

## Installation
Once inside, the attacker may establish persistence by creating backdoor accounts or installing malware to maintain access to the web application. This allows the attacker to control the system remotely and execute additional attacks without detection.

## Actions on Objectives
With full access to the web application, the attacker can exfiltrate sensitive user data, including personally identifiable information (PII) and financial details. They may also manipulate critical system data, compromise user sessions, or disrupt application functionality, leading to data breaches and reputational damage for the organization.
