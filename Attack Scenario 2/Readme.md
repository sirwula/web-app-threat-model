# Attack 2 Summary: SQL Injection Leading to Data Breach and Unauthorized Access

## Stages of the Attack

## Origins

The attack is initiated by a malicious actor exploiting security vulnerabilities in the web application. The target is chosen due to its inadequate input validation, which exposes the backend database to malicious queries. The application’s public-facing nature and its access to sensitive information make it an attractive target for data theft and manipulation.

## Reconnaissance

The attacker first performs reconnaissance on the web application. They analyze entry points such as login pages, search fields, and other input forms, looking for unprotected areas where unsanitized user inputs are passed to the database. Additionally, the attacker gathers information about the web application's backend database and structure to prepare for the attack.

## Weaponization

After discovering that the web application does not properly validate or sanitize inputs, the attacker crafts a malicious SQL query designed to exploit the input fields. The SQL query is aimed at bypassing authentication controls or directly querying the database to extract sensitive data, such as usernames, passwords, or personal information.

## Delivery

The malicious SQL payload is delivered by the attacker through vulnerable input fields in the application. These could be login forms, search bars, or URL parameters where user-supplied input is processed. The crafted payloads may include SQL statements such as:

sql
' OR 1=1 --

This query tricks the database into executing unauthorized commands, bypassing login restrictions or extracting confidential data.

## Exploitation

Once the SQL payload is executed, the attacker gains unauthorized access to the web application's database. They can view or manipulate sensitive data, including user credentials, personally identifiable information (PII), and other critical system records. The attacker can also delete or modify existing data, causing disruptions to the application’s services.

## Installation

To ensure persistence, the attacker may create administrative backdoor accounts within the database, enabling continued access. They might also attempt to modify database configurations or establish a foothold by creating new, unmonitored users with administrative privileges.

## Actions on Objectives

With full control of the database, the attacker can extract sensitive data, manipulate critical system information, or delete records. They may sell stolen data on the black market, or use it for further exploitation, such as impersonating users, executing financial fraud, or conducting more attacks within the compromised infrastructure.

## Remediation

To mitigate the impact of SQL injection, organizations should:

Implement input validation and parameterized queries.
Sanitize user inputs to ensure no direct execution of SQL commands.
Regularly audit the database for suspicious activities or anomalies.
Apply the principle of least privilege for database user roles.

# SQL Injection Attack Flow Summary

Step 1: Reconnaissance: The attacker analyzes the web application for input points that pass unsanitized data to the database.
Step 2: Weaponization: The attacker crafts a malicious SQL query to exploit the vulnerable input field.
Step 3: Delivery: The payload is delivered through a vulnerable form, typically a login or search field.
Step 4: Exploitation: The SQL query is executed by the database, giving the attacker unauthorized access.
Step 5: Installation: To maintain access, the attacker may create backdoor accounts or alter the database.
Step 6: Actions on Objectives: The attacker exfiltrates data, manipulates records, or disrupts the service.
