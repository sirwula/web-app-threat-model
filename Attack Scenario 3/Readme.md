# Stages of the Attack

##Origins
The attacker initiates the attack by targeting an ecommerce platform that handles sensitive customer information, such as payment details and personal data. The public-facing nature of the website and the large number of  users make it an attractive target for exploitation.

## Reconnaissance
The attacker conducts research on the ecommerce platform, identifying input fields (e.g., product review sections, search bars, user profiles) that could be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The attacker analyzes the platform’s architecture and how it handles user input, searching for weaknesses.

## Weaponization
The attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript payload designed to execute within the browsers of users interacting with the compromised pages. The payload may aim to steal session cookies, payment information, or other sensitive data that can lead to account takeover or unauthorized purchases.

## Delivery
The attacker injects the malicious script into vulnerable input fields (such as a product review or search bar). This script is either stored on the site (stored XSS) or reflected back to users when they interact with the page (reflected XSS).

## Exploitation
When legitimate users visit the compromised page, the malicious JavaScript is executed within their browser. The attacker gains access to session cookies, login tokens, or even the users’ payment information, depending on the scope of the compromised page.

## Installation
Although no malware is typically installed during an XSS attack, the attacker may establish persistence by continuously exploiting the vulnerable page to collect sensitive data. The attacker might redirect users to phishing sites or execute additional malicious actions during the user's session.

## Actions on Objectives
With access to session data or payment information, the attacker can impersonate users, make unauthorized purchases, or exfiltrate sensitive customer data. The attacker may also redirect users to malicious websites to further exploit their credentials or financial information.

## Controls and Mitigations
To prevent XSS attacks on the ecommerce platform, the following security controls should be implemented:
Input Validation: Ensure all user inputs are strictly validated and sanitized to prevent script injection in input fields like product reviews, comments, or search bars.
Output Encoding: Encode all user-generated content before displaying it on web pages to prevent browsers from interpreting user input as executable code.
Content Security Policy (CSP): Enforce a strict CSP that limits the execution of scripts to trusted sources, minimizing the impact of XSS attacks.
HttpOnly Cookies: Use HttpOnly and Secure flags for session cookies to prevent them from being accessed by JavaScript, reducing the risk of session hijacking.
Regular Security Audits: Conduct periodic security testing and code audits to identify and patch vulnerabilities in input validation and output rendering.
## Summary
This README outlines the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack scenario targeting the ecommerce platform. The attacker identifies vulnerable input fields, injects malicious scripts, and steals sensitive customer data such as session cookies and payment information. Effective security controls, such as input validation, output encoding, and content security policies, are essential in mitigating the risk of XSS attacks.
